## The SEI Decomposition Process
Solid electrolyte interphase is a key component in lithiumion battery health, which is closely related to temperature and thermal safety. During the first discharge, the SEI is formulated on the anode surface with the electrolyte decomposition.
The SEI existence prevents continuous electrolyte loss in the following process. Once the SEI decomposes, fast capacity degradation and thermal runaway might occur.
With the experimental platform in Fig. 2, the SEI morphologies are shown in Fig. 3 under different operating temperatures. From (d), (e), (f), it can be found that the SEI becomes thinner in some areas due to the high temperature. If the temperatures continue increasing above 50â„ƒ, the SEI breakage would happen and cause the fire.
